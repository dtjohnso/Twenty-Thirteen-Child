Twenty-Thirteen-Child
=====================

A child theme to the Wordpress theme Twenty Thirteen. Works with Twenty Thirteen 1.2. I built this child theme to use on a Wordpress Multi-Site setup where I frequently deploy new sites using the same theme. In the past, I would use plugins to achieve certain front-end functions, but doing so meant that every time I deployed a new site I had to reconfigure plugin settings. By integrating my own custom CSS and a few favorite JS plugins into this theme, I eliminate the need to reconfigure on each new deploy.

Features
--------

* Minor adjustments to theme CSS to suit my preferences for formatting
* [RefTagger](http://reftagger.com/) integration.
* Implements Fluidbox 2.0.4 by Terry Mun ([Demo](http://terrymun.github.io/Fluidbox/), [Github](https://github.com/terrymun/Fluidbox)) on images in posts.
