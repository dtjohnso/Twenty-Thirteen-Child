Twenty-Thirteen-Child
=====================

A child theme to the Wordpress theme Twenty Thirteen. Works with Twenty Thirteen 1.2.

Features
--------

* Minor adjustments to theme CSS to suit my preferences for formatting
* Implements Fluidbox 1.3.0 by Terry Mun ([Demo](http://terrymun.github.io/Fluidbox/), [Github](https://github.com/terrymun/Fluidbox)) on images in posts, obviating the need for a separate lightbox plugin. I did this because I use this theme on a Wordpress Multi-Site setup where I frequently deploy new sites using this child theme. By integrating the lightbox into the theme, rather than using a separate plugin, I eliminate the need to reconfigure the lightbox plugin settings every time I deploy a new site.
